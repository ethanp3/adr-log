# Use a Lab-Based study to perform user testing and evaluate the prototype system

## Context and Problem Statement

There are several methods that can be used to allow test users to evaluate the prototype system. One should be selected in order to create a
user evaluation test plan.

## Decision Drivers

* Depth of testing - how extensive and realistic the testing scenarios provided by the evaluation method are

## Considered Options

* Lab-Based Study
* Focus Group
* Interviews

## Decision Outcome

A Lab-Based Study method will be used. Test users will be solicited and invited to attend the AFS Office on a specific date to complete the testing
yet to be confirmed.

### Consequences

* Good, because it gives the company a chance to interact directly with prospective users to gather feedback
* Bad, as there may be issues or difficultes running an in-person event, such as no-shows or hardware/system failure

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Lab-Based Study

* Good, because users can test the system in-person and provide feedback
* Good, because staff can observe how users interact with the system in person and ask questions
* Neutral, because the in-person setting may influence how users interact with the system and could be off-putting
* Bad, because because it requires staff to host and manage the event and testing environment, where problems may arise from an in-person event

### Focus Group

* Good, because it allows a setting for users to discuss ideas and share their experiences and frustrations
* Good, because a wide range of people can be selected to participate, taking into consideration different types of users, accessibility neeeds etc.
* Bad, for the same reason as a Lab-Based Study. It requires staff to host and manage the event and testing environment, where problems may arise from an in-person event
* Bad, because some people may not want to speak as much in a group setting or may not want to raise their concerns.

### Interviews

* Good, because they can be hosted either in-person or remotely
* Good, because the evaluations can be tailored to each user as the interviews are not reliant on a group environment
* Bad, because it may be time-consuming and feedback could be repeated multiple times by different test participants
